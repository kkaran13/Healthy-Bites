        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">What is protein?</h1>
        <p className="my-4">Protein is a nutrient your body needs to grow and repair cells, and to work properly.</p>
        <p className="my-4">Protein is found in a wide range of food and it’s important that you get enough protein in your diet every day. How much protein you need from your diet varies depending on your weight, gender, age and health.</p>
        <p className="my-4">Meeting your protein needs is easily achieved from eating a variety of foods. Protein from food comes from plant and animal sources such as:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 my-4">
          <li>meat and fish</li>
          <li>eggs</li>
          <li>dairy products</li>
          <li>seeds and nuts</li>
          <li>legumes like beans and lentils.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Nutritional value of protein</h2>
        
        <p className="my-4">The nutritional value of a protein is measured by the quantity of essential amino acids it contains.</p>
        <p className="my-4">Different foods contain different amounts of essential amino acids. Generally:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 my-4">
          <li>Animal products (such as chicken, beef or fish and dairy products) have all of the essential amino acids and are known as 'complete' protein (or ideal or high-quality protein).</li>
          <li>Soy products, quinoa and the seed of a leafy green called amaranth (consumed in Asia and the Mediterranean) also have all of the essential amino acids.</li>
          <li>Plant proteins (beans, lentils, nuts and whole grains) usually lack at least one of the essential amino acids and are considered 'incomplete' proteins.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="my-4">People following a strict vegetarian or vegan diet need to choose a variety of protein sources from a combination of plant foods every day to make sure they get an adequate mix of essential amino acids.</p>
        <p className="my-4">If you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, as long as you eat a wide variety of foods, you can usually get the protein you need. For example, a meal containing cereals and legumes, such as baked beans on toast, provides all the essential amino acids found in a typical meat dish.</p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Protein foods</h2>
        <p className="my-4">Some food sources of dietary protein include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 my-4">
          <li>lean meats – beef, lamb, veal, pork, kangaroo</li>
          <li>poultry – chicken, turkey, duck, emu, goose, bush birds</li>
          <li>fish and seafood – fish, prawns, crab, lobster, mussels, oysters, scallops, clams</li>
          <li>eggs</li>
          <li>dairy products – milk, yoghurt (especially Greek yoghurt), cheese (especially cottage cheese)</li>
          <li>nuts (including nut pastes) and seeds – almonds, pine nuts, walnuts, macadamias, hazelnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds</li>
          <li>legumes and beans – all beans, lentils, chickpeas, split peas, tofu.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="my-4">Some grain and cereal-based products are also sources of protein, but are generally not as high in protein as meat and meat-alternative products.</p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold my-4">How to get your protein needs</h2>
        <p className="my-4">Your daily protein needs can easily be met by following the Australian Dietary Guidelines. The Guidelines group foods into 5 different food groups, each of which provide key nutrients.</p>
        <p className="my-4">The 2 main food groups that contribute to protein are the:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 my-4">
          <li>‘lean meat and poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds and legumes/beans’ group</li>
          <li>‘milk, yoghurt, cheese and/or alternatives (mostly reduced fat)’ group.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="my-4">As part of a healthy diet, the Guidelines recommend particular serves per day from each of the 5 food groups.</p>
        <p className="my-4">The human body can’t store protein and will excrete any excess, so the most effective way of meeting your daily protein requirement is to eat small amounts at every meal.</p>
        <p className="my-4">Daily recommended serves of ‘lean meat and poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds and legumes/beans’ and ‘milk, yoghurt, cheese and/or alternatives (mostly reduced fat)’ for adults</p>
        
        <img className="rounded-lg border-gray-800 border" src="image1.png" alt=""/>
        <p className="my-4">So, what is a serve? A standard serving size of ‘lean meat and poultry, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds, and legumes/beans’ is one of:</p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 my-4">
          <li>65 g cooked lean meats such as beef, lamb, veal, pork, goat or kangaroo (about 90 to 100 g raw)</li>
          <li>80 g cooked lean poultry such as chicken or turkey (100 g raw)</li>
          <li>100 g cooked fish fillet (about 115 g raw weight) or one small can of fish</li>
          <li>1 cup (150 g) cooked dried beans, lentils, chickpeas, split peas or canned beans (preferably with no added salt)</li>
          <li>170 g tofu</li>
          <li>30 g nuts, seeds, peanut or almond butter or tahini or other nut or seed paste (no added salt).</li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="my-4">A serve of ‘milk, yoghurt, cheese and/or alternatives (mostly reduced fat)’ could include:</p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 my-4">
          <li>250 ml (1 cup) fresh, UHT long life, reconstituted powdered milk or buttermilk</li>
          <li>120 ml (1/2 cup) evaporated milk</li>
          <li>200 g (3/4 cup or 1 small carton) yoghurt</li>
          <li>40 g (2 slices) hard cheese such as cheddar</li>
          <li>120 g (1/2 cup) ricotta cheese.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p className="my-4">Protein requirements for children and teenagers change as they grow. <a className="text-blue-300" href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/food-essentials/how-much-do-we-need-each-day/recommended-number-serves-children-adolescents-and-toddlers">Read about the recommended number of serves for children, adolescents and toddlers for all 5 food groups.</a></p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Getting more protein into your day, naturally</h2>
        <p className="my-4">If you’re looking for ways to get more protein into your diet, here are some suggestions:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 my-4">
          <li>Try a peanut butter sandwich. Remember to use natural peanut butter (or any other nut paste) with no added salt, sugar or other fillers.</li>
          <li>Low-fat cottage or ricotta cheese is high in protein and can go in your scrambled eggs, casserole, mashed potato or pasta dish. Or spread it on your toast in the morning.</li>
          <li>Nuts and seeds are fantastic in salads, with vegetables and served on top of curries. Try toasting some pine nuts or flaked almonds and putting them in your green salad.</li>
          <li>Beans are great in soups, casseroles, and pasta sauces. Try tipping a drained can of cannellini beans into your favourite vegetable soup recipe or casserole.</li>
          <li>A plate of hummus and freshly cut vegetable sticks as a snack or hummus spread on your sandwich will give you easy extra protein at lunchtime.</li>
          <li>Greek yoghurt is a protein rich food that you can use throughout the day. Add some on your favourite breakfast cereal, put a spoonful on top of a bowl of pumpkin soup or serve it as dessert with some fresh fruit.</li>
          <li>Eggs are a versatile and easy option that can be enjoyed on their own or mixed in a variety of dishes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Getting too little protein (protein deficiency)</h2>
        <p className="my-4">Protein deficiency means not getting enough protein in your diet. Protein deficiency is rare in Australia, as the Australian diet generally includes far more protein than we actually need. However, protein deficiency may occur in people with special requirements, such as older people and people following strict vegetarian or vegan diets.</p>
        <p className="my-4">Symptoms of protein deficiency include:</p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 my-4">
          <li>wasting and shrinkage of muscle tissue</li>
          <li>oedema (build-up of fluids, particularly in the feet and ankles)</li>
          <li>anaemia (the blood’s inability to deliver sufficient oxygen to the cells, usually caused by dietary deficiencies such as lack of iron)</li>
          <li>slow growth (in children).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Very high protein diets are dangerous</h2>
        <p className="my-4">Some fad diets promote very high protein intakes of between 200 and 400 g per day. This is more than 5 times the amount recommended in the Australian Dietary Guidelines.</p>
        <p className="my-4">The protein recommendations in the Guidelines provide enough protein to build and repair muscles, even for body builders and athletes.</p>
        <p className="my-4">A very high-protein diet can strain the kidneys and liver. It can also prompt excessive loss of the mineral calcium, which can increase your risk of osteoporosis.</p>
